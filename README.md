# MLOps Integration for Chest CT Scan Model

This repository aims to incorporate MLOps practices into a project based on a chest CT scan model that has already been developed. The model from [my repository](https://github.com/drtey/chest-CT-Scan) is being enhanced with MLOps using principles and implementations inspired by [this example project](https://github.com/entbappy/Chest-Disease-Classification-from-Chest-CT-Scan-Image).

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this repository is to integrate Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) into an existing chest CT scan classification model. By utilizing MLOps, we aim to automate, monitor, and optimize the deployment and maintenance of the machine learning model to ensure reliable and scalable production-level applications.

## Features

- **Model Integration**: Incorporating a pre-built chest CT scan model.
- **MLOps Implementation**: Applying MLOps methodologies inspired by the example project.
- **MLflow Deployment**: Leveraging MLflow for model tracking, experimentation, and deployment.
- **Scalability**: Ensuring the model can be scaled and managed effectively in production environments.

## Repository Structure

- `model/`: Contains the original model files from the chest CT scan project.
- `mlops/`: Includes scripts and configurations for implementing MLOps.
- `deployment/`: Resources for deploying the model using MLflow.

## Usage

To use the integrated model with MLOps:

1. Prepare your input data as required by the model.
2. Run inference using the deployed model endpoint.
3. Monitor the performance and logs using MLflow.
